//second task
// my age variable named "my age"

//new variable named earlyyear and its value is 2
let earlyyear = 2 // the value of this variBLE WILL CHANGE
//earlyyear value change to 2*25

//here we multipling the later year value to 4
lateryear *= 4

//the final answer is console there we assigned myname , myage , my age in cat years
